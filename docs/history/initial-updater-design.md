# MS42/MS42P postmerkOS firmware updater — first implementation

This package replaces the existing `fw_upgrade` shell-only approach with a
transport-independent updater and a small **statically linked RAM flasher**.
It is designed for the current 16 MiB RedBoot/NOR layout:

| Region | Offset | Size | Updater behavior |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| RedBoot | `0x000000` | 256 KiB | never touched |
| Kernel/SPIM | `0x040000` | 2816 KiB | never touched |
| SquashFS | `0x300000` | 8 MiB | always updated |
| JFFS2/config | `0xB00000` | 5 MiB | preserve, migrate, reset, or use image |

The updater is intended only for switches already running this alternative
firmware. It does not install over stock Meraki firmware.

## Why a static helper is used

Erasing the mounted SquashFS while executing `/bin/sh`, BusyBox, `flash_erase`,
or shared libraries from that SquashFS is fragile. Copying only the executable
to `/tmp` is not sufficient when it is dynamically linked or demand-paged.

`fw_update` therefore requires its work directory to be on tmpfs, performs all
validation and preparation first, copies the static `fwflash` helper to RAM,
stops all other userspace processes, unmounts `/etc`, `/root`, and `/overlay`,
takes consistent rollback snapshots, and then `exec`s the helper. The helper:

1. validates both MTD devices and all staged/rollback images;
2. flashes JFFS2 first when requested;
3. flashes SquashFS last;
4. erases the complete partition;
5. writes and reads back every byte;
6. verifies that any unwritten tail remains erased (`0xff`);
7. retries once after a failed write/verification;
8. treats SquashFS and an optional JFFS2 replacement as one transaction;
9. restores every changed partition if a later stage fails;
10. reboots immediately after success or after the rollback attempt.

This greatly improves failure handling, but it cannot make a single-partition
layout power-fail atomic. Loss of power while SquashFS is erased or being
written can still require the CH341A recovery path.

## Included commands

- `fw_update`: validates and installs a local image.
- `fw_update_http`: gathers indexes from configured HTTP(S) repositories,
  presents a numbered list, downloads the selected image and sidecar, and calls
  `fw_update`.
- `fw_update_tftp`: downloads an explicitly named image and sidecar by TFTP.
- `fw_update_sftp`: downloads an explicitly named image and sidecar by SFTP.
- `fw_update_status`: prints or watches the JSON status file.

Runtime status is written atomically to:

```text
/run/fwupdate/status.json
```

Logs are written to:

```text
/run/fwupdate/update.log
/run/fwupdate/flash.log
```

A future web endpoint can launch a command with `--yes` and poll the JSON file.
The web/SSH connection will disappear when services are stopped and the switch
reboots; that is expected. `/run` is volatile, so the final status is not retained
across the reboot in this first implementation.

## Overlay policies

### `preserve` — default

JFFS2 is not written at all. This preserves every current setting and every
other upper-layer file byte-for-byte.

The tradeoff is that old files in the JFFS2 upper layer can continue to shadow
new files supplied by the new SquashFS.

### `migrate`

Builds a clean JFFS2 image and copies only paths listed in:

```text
/etc/fwupdate/preserve.list
```

The initial list retains switch configuration, MAC/board information, Dropbear
keys, the root password database, and `/root/.ssh`. This is the preferred policy
once the exact persistent-data contract has been validated on the switch.

### `reset`

Builds and flashes an empty but valid JFFS2 overlay containing only the required
OverlayFS `.upper` and `.work` directories.

### `image`

Extracts and flashes the final 5 MiB region from a complete 16 MiB firmware
image. It is rejected for a standalone SquashFS input.

## Checksum format

Every remote image must have a same-name sidecar:

```text
ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin
ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin.sha256
```

The sidecar must contain the basename, not an absolute build-host path:

```text
0123456789abcdef...  ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin
```

The updater rejects a sidecar whose recorded filename does not exactly match
the downloaded image.


## Transport and authenticity model

The SHA-256 sidecar detects corruption and prevents a mismatched image/sidecar
pair from being installed. A checksum downloaded from the same unauthenticated
HTTP or TFTP server does **not** prove who published the image: an attacker able
to replace the firmware can replace its checksum too.

For an authenticated update channel, use one of:

- HTTPS with a valid certificate and the installed CA bundle;
- SFTP with `--hostpubsha256`;
- SFTP with a pre-populated `known_hosts` file.

The SFTP wrapper refuses a connection without a host-key pin or known-hosts
file unless `--insecure-host-key` is explicitly supplied. HTTPS redirects are
restricted to HTTPS, preventing an HTTPS source from silently downgrading to
plain HTTP.

This design does not yet add a separately signed release manifest. A future
version should add an offline release-signing key if firmware authenticity must
remain verifiable even when the download server is compromised.

## HTTP(S) repository format

Configure repositories in `/etc/fwupdate/sources.conf`:

```text
# name|base URL|index filename
official|https://firmware.example.net/postmerkos/ms42p|index.tsv
lab|http://192.168.1.20/firmware/ms42p|index.tsv
```

Each repository provides `index.tsv`:

```text
# version|target|firmware filename|byte size|description
20260615-120000|ms42p|ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin|16777216|Stable build
20260614-230000|ms42p|ms42p-postmerkos-20260614-230000.bin|16777216|Previous build
```

Bad or unreachable configured indexes are skipped. At least one compatible
entry must remain.

The included host helper publishes an artifact and atomically updates the
index:

```bash
./host/fwupdate-publish.sh \
  ~/meraki-ms42p-build/artifacts/ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin \
  /srv/http/firmware/ms42p \
  20260615-120000 \
  "Web UI and updater build"
```

## Command examples

Interactive HTTP repository selection, retaining JFFS2 exactly:

```sh
fw_update_http
```

Headless HTTP install by version, migrating only approved settings:

```sh
fw_update_http --version 20260615-120000 --overlay migrate --yes
```

Direct HTTPS URL:

```sh
fw_update_http \
  --url https://server.example/fw/ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin \
  --overlay preserve --yes
```

TFTP:

```sh
fw_update_tftp \
  --server 192.168.1.20 \
  --file firmware/ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin \
  --overlay preserve --yes
```

SFTP with a pinned SSH host public-key hash:

```sh
fw_update_sftp \
  --server files.example.net \
  --file /firmware/ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin \
  --user updater \
  --password-file /tmp/sftp-password \
  --hostpubsha256 'BASE64_SHA256_VALUE' \
  --overlay migrate --yes
```

SFTP using an existing OpenSSH known-hosts file:

```sh
fw_update_sftp \
  --server files.example.net \
  --file /firmware/ms42p-postmerkos-20260615-120000.bin \
  --user updater \
  --password-file /tmp/sftp-password \
  --known-hosts /root/.ssh/known_hosts \
  --overlay preserve --yes
```

SFTP defaults to username `anonymous` and an empty password when credentials
are omitted, but SFTP has no standardized anonymous-login mechanism; the server
must actually provide such an account.

Validate a local file and sidecar without flashing:

```sh
fw_update --verify-only \
  --checksum /tmp/firmware.bin.sha256 \
  /tmp/firmware.bin
```

Watch status:

```sh
fw_update_status --watch
```

## Repository and Buildroot integration

The updater is maintained as a normal package in the `meraki-builder` source
tree:

```text
buildroot/packages/fwupdate/
├── Config.in
├── fwupdate.mk
├── fwflash.c
└── files/
```

The shared custom package menu registers it through:

```text
buildroot/packages/Config.in
```

During `make prepare`, `scripts/prepare-buildroot.sh` copies the package into
the extracted Buildroot tree and enables:

```text
BR2_SHARED_STATIC_LIBS=y
BR2_PACKAGE_FWUPDATE=y
BR2_PACKAGE_FWUPDATE_CURL=y
```

Shared-plus-static libc support is required because the small `fwflash` helper
is copied into tmpfs and runs while the SquashFS partition that normally holds
shared libraries is being erased. The normal userspace continues to use shared
libraries.

No separate stage-15 integration or rebuild script is used. A normal build is
enough:

```bash
make base
# or
make web
```

Run the host-side package checks independently with:

```bash
make test-fwupdate
```

The standard image validator confirms that the updater scripts and configuration
are installed, that `fwflash` is statically linked, and that required target
commands are present. Image checksum sidecars are generated from within the
artifact directory so the sidecar contains only the firmware basename.

Because the updater and transport libraries consume additional SquashFS space,
the existing 8 MiB size check remains authoritative. The build aborts rather
than producing an oversized image.


## Validation status

The shell scripts pass POSIX-shell syntax checks, and the RAM flasher builds
cleanly as a static executable with `-Wall -Wextra -Werror`. The publisher and
strict sidecar parser were also exercised against generated test artifacts.
The updater has **has been successfully tested on the physical MS42P NOR device
through TFTP + hardware serial**, so the serial-attached validation sequence
below only remains as a reference for validating future updates.

## Hardware validation sequence

Prepare a CH341A backup/recovery setup and start with `preserve`:

1. Flash an updater-enabled image externally.
2. Boot and save `/proc/mtd`, `mount`, and `fw_update --verify-only` output.
3. Publish the same image under a different test filename and run an HTTP
   `--verify-only` download.
4. Build a harmless changed SquashFS, then install it with
   `--overlay preserve` while attached to serial.
5. Confirm SSH, UI, `/etc/switch.json`, host keys, password, and switch state.
6. Test `--overlay reset` only after the preserve path is confirmed.
7. Intentionally corrupt a staged image after checksum generation to confirm it
   is rejected before services are stopped.

Do not test power interruption during the first software update unless an
external full-flash backup and immediate hardware recovery are ready.
