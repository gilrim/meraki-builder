# Pre-kernel UART recovery

The pre-kernel path is supplied by the source-built meraki-redboot boot region.
It does not require Linux, networking, SSH or a working root filesystem.

| Path | Bootstrap | Firmware transport | Flash engine |
|---|---|---|---|
| Normal UART update | Linux userspace | `PMOSUART/1` | Linux MTD updater |
| Embedded recovery | menu option 2 at 115200 | PMOSREC v3 adaptive binary transport | embedded family recovery stage |
| RAM-upload recovery | `PMOSRAM2` at 115200 | PMOSREC v3 adaptive binary transport | freshly uploaded family recovery stage |

## Boot menu and stable recovery boundary

Stage 1 reports `PMOSBOOT MENU-PROBE`. The host sends carriage return as the
menu trigger and selects:

1. `UART-RAMLOADER` for a fresh executable;
2. `FW-RECOVERY` for the payload embedded in the loader.

No input, invalid input or menu timeout continues normal boot. The RAM loader
validates load range, entry address, frame CRC-32, object CRC-32 and SHA-256
before executing the payload. This bootstrap always uses 115200 baud.

## PMOSREC v3

The current stage reports:

```text
PMOSREC READY 3 SOC=<family>
PMOSREC DESCRIPTOR PMOSRECOVERY3;...;PROTO=3;PREFLIGHT=4;...;END
PMOSREC UART-CAP CLOCK=<hz> DIV_MIN=1 DIV_MAX=65535 CURRENT=115200
```

The host waits for the complete descriptor and early SPI NOR preflight before
sending commands. PMOSREC then negotiates the fastest target-generated UART
rate that passes deterministic bidirectional CRC testing. Every failed switch
rolls back independently to the previous known-good rate.

Production transfer prefers 4096-byte frames and up to 16 frames in flight.
Compact CRC-protected acknowledgements carry a cumulative window and selective
retry bitmap. Frame size and window fall back independently.

The manifest is sent and validated first. The host then chooses the smallest
qualified representation among raw, sparse, LZ4 and sparse-LZ4. PMOSREC
reconstructs the exact 16 MiB image in RAM and verifies its complete SHA-256
before an erase challenge can be issued.

See [PMOSREC v3 adaptive UART transport](pmosrec-v3-adaptive-uart.md) for the
wire protocol, rollback and integrity details.

## Destructive authorization

The wrapper requires full-image authorization before invoking PMOSREC. After
all target validation succeeds, PMOSREC emits a live `ERASEFLASH <nonce>`
challenge. The wrapper responds automatically under the prior `FLASH-ALL`
authorization. Manual diagnostic mode waits forever and allows unlimited
incorrect retries; power cycling cancels.

After full erase, program and readback verification, PMOSREC performs a
five-second countdown and requests the SoC soft-chip reset.

## Family naming boundary

The boot/recovery layer calls MS42/MS42P hardware `jaguar1` because it selects
the Jaguar1 SPI register map. The Linux runtime remains `jaguar_dual` and loads
the donor `jaguar_dual` switch modules. These namespaces are intentionally
separate.
